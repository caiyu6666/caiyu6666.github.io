I am a Ph.D. student at [Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Kwang-Ting (Tim) Cheng](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng) and Prof. [Hao Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~jhc/), since 2022 fall. Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree (with Honours) at the  Excellent Engineer Class of [School of Electronic Information and Communications (EIC)](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in June, 2022. At HUST, I was lucky to do research with Prof. [Xin Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/xinyang/home) and Prof. [Yu Zhou](https://www.vlrlab.net/~yuzhou). 

Here is my [CV](https://caiyu6666.github.io/files/YuCai_resume.pdf).
